    "story": "I began building Recreation with my brother Ian Watts, in August of 2022. Ian is a University of Michigan Alum with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. <br> <br>As young kids, my brother would spend summer days in our garage wielding power tools constructing wood working projects. Not sure how we kept all of our fingers. Our first project was a Go-Kart built on top of a Radio Flyer Wagon. After watching Lord of the Rings, we thought it was time to build a catapult powered by bungee cords. Impressively we could launch a tennis ball some 60 feet. <br> <br>As we grew older, we began to take on more ambitious projects. When my brother got a Makergear M2 3D printer for his 16th birthday, we began to learn the power of iterative design. Within a matter of hours we could print many variations of any given part. We used this 3D printer to create the first prototypes of what would become the Recreation Grinder. \n\nWe began the design process by analyzing leaders in the luxury cannabis grinder industry such as <a style='text-decoration: underline;' href='https://santacruzshredder.com/'>Santa Cruz</a> and <a style='text-decoration: underline;' href='https://www.hoj.life/products/klip'>Hoj</a>. Next we took a first principals approach to how we could differentiate our product. <br> <br>The final product is significantly lighter than the competition, uses magnetic connections (instead of threading) to connect all pieces, and is completely modular. This design process along with my brother and I's passion for design has resulted in a product that is both beautiful and functional."
