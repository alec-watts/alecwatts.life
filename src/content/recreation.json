    "story": "In August 2022, my brother Ian Watts and I embarked on a journey to create Recreation. Ian, a University of Michigan alumnus, holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering. <br/> <br/> From our early childhood, Ian and I have always been passionate about creation and fabrication. In our family garage, we initially dabbled in woodworking, crafting go-karts, catapults, cutting boards, lamps, and even a bed.  <br/> <br/> Our perspective on product design was revolutionized when Ian received a MakerGear M2 3D printer for his birthday. This gift enabled us to comprehend the significance of rapid prototyping and iterative design. Within a matter of hours, we could print multiple versions of the same component using the 3D printer. This powerful tool allowed us to develop the initial prototypes of what would eventually become the innovative Recreation Grinder. <br/><br/>The final product boasts several distinct advantages over its competitors: <ul> <li> - It is substantially lighter in weight</li> <li> - It utilizes magnetic connections, rather than threading, to assemble all parts </li> <li> - It features a fully modular design </li> </ul> <br/>By adopting a first-principles approach, we have successfully crafted a product that is both highly functional  and aesthetically."
