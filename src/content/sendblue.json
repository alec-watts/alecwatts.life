    "story": "During my internship at SendBlue, a company offering iMessaging infrastructure for businesses, I gained valuable experience in web development while honing my skills in JavaScript and Node.js. I was responsible for the improvement and expansion of the user dashboard, which serves as a visual interface for clients to view and send messages (similar to the iMessage app). I navigated complex production code that had accumulated over two years, learning to strike the right balance between refactoring and introducing new features. Most significantly, I recognized the challenges associated with client-side dynamic pages that do not utilize React. Manual manipulation of the DOM tree in files with hundreds of lines of code inspired me to complete the React Codecademy course during winter break and further develop my expertise in Web Systems this semester. <br/> <br/>To provide prospective clients with a test of the product, I devised a <a style='text-decoration: underline;' href='https://tally.so/r/wLDodv' target='_blank'>SendBlue ChatGPT + DALL-E chatbot</a>. To accomplish this, I established a Node server with a PostgreSQL database that made simple calls to the OpenAI API with the context of the 20 most recent messages. My time at SendBlue provided invaluable exposure to production code and web technologies, fostering an understanding of best practices in future development."
